# Where's Waldo? Game

This is a fun interactive game on the web where players earch for a Waldo hidden inside an image. The game is built using HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript, and CSS.

## Features
**Interactive gameplay**: Click on the canvas to find Waldo! If you're wrong, the game will prompt you to "try again!".
**Mouse feedback**: Displays the mouse coordinates in the console for debugging and gameplay enhancement. This makes it easy to add levels if necessary.
**Levels**: There are three levels of gameplay with unique images.

## What I learned
During the development of this game, I learned many important programming and web development concepts.
1. **Event Handling**: Using JavaScript to capture and handle the mouse click events and calculating accurate mouse positions relative to the canvas.
2. **Game Logic**: Structuring code to manage different game states like title, menu, gameplay.
3. **Image Preloading**: Ensuring all images are loaded before rendering gameplay elements to make sure there are so potential errors later on during the playing of the game.
4. **User Experience**: Creating a clean, responsive and engaging interface with clear feedback for players.
